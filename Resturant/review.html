		<h1>Customer-1</h1>
		<p>Vanares center was an extremely intense and noisy town and the epicenter had too much of energies. Like a concentration of India. No way to relax in this town. So I was happy to have booked outside town in a quiet location. Rooms were very silent and people were respectful of each other.
The food at the hostel was also really great.
I loved the common area - the livingroom and the patio (courtyard) - with sitting tables that creates an almost familiar athmosphere of being at home. It is easy to connect with other travelers and I was happy to connect with a family from Canada who stayed in the same hostel as me in Delhi.</p>
